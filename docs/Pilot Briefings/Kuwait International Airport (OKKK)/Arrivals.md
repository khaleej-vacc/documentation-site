# Pilot Briefing

## Initial Contact
As the pilot of your aircraft it is your responsibility to ensure you have listened to the **A-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** so you know the active runways, current weather and any other operational information at the airfeild.

When either the En-Route Controller or Approach Controller asks you to contact them you should do so immediately.
On initial contact with the controller you should provide the following information:

- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Current Flight Level or Altitude
- Current ATIS Letter you're in reciept of

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Center, JZR742 with you FL220, Airbus A320, Information C"**_

Once you have made initial contact the controller will identify you on radar and proceed to give you instructions for how you should arrive into Kuwait.

## Assigned Standard Terminal Arrival Route & Approach
After you make initial contact with the controller they will provide you with a **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**, an approach aid that you will use for landing at Kuwait and in some cases an altitude to descend too.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR742, Identified, DEBTI3C Arrival, expect ILS Approach Y Runway 33R, descend Flight Level 150."**_

You must read back this clearance in full as it contains very important information.
You must cross check your charts, ensure the arrival assigned is in your navigation database, if it is not you must inform the controller immediately.

You must adhere to any flight level, altitude or speed restrictions annotated on the relevant arrival chart unless advised otherwise by the controller.

## Approach

Once the controler has descended you to start your final approach you will be cleared for the approach type you were issued.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR742, via PEDEL, cleared the ILS Y Approach RWY33R, report established"**_

Again, you must read this back correctly and fully.

It is a standard rule of thumb within Kuwait, you should be 180kts at 10DME, 160kts at 4dme to ensure safe and efficent operations.
Once you are established you will advise the controller.

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Approach, JZR742, fully established ILS Y Runway 33R"**_

The Approach Controller will then hand you over to the Tower Controller.

## Landing
On initial contact with the Tower Controller you should provide the following.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Tower, JZR742, fully established ILS33R 7DME"**_

The Tower Controller will either advise you to continue approach or clear you to land.

## After Landing
Upon arrival in Kuwait you should aim to vacate by one of the following points:

| **Runway** | **Exit Points** |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     33R    |   Loop 2        |
|     33L    |   W4 or W5      |
|     15R    |   W2            |
|     15L    |   E2            |

Once you have done so the Tower Controller will provide you with an initial taxi instruction to get you away from the holding point efficiently and hand you over to the Ground Controller who will provide you with further taxi instructions to your Stand.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR742, Welcome to Kuwait, taxi via E9, W17, Stand B2."**_

Again, please ensure you have the charts available and read back the instructions correctly.
You will then taxi to stand and no further communications need to be made.
