# Departing Aircraft

## Chapter 2: Requesting Clearance

Prior to contacting Kuwait Delivery (DEL) the pilot should have listened to the **D-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** to obtain the latest and up to date current weather conditions at **Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)** along with any additional airfield operational information such as runway information, closures etc.

On first contact with Kuwait Delivery you as the pilot should report the following information:

- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Stand Number
- Current ATIS Information Letter
- Current QNH

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Delivery, JZR741, Airbus A320, Stand B1, Information D On-board, QNH 1002, requesting IFR Clearance to Giza"**_

The controller will then proceed to give you a clearance which must be read back in **full** and **correctly**.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, Good Afternoon, cleared to Giza via the KFR4F, climb initially altitude 4000ft, Squawk 4414"**_

Below you can find the Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) from OKKK and their initial altitudes.

| **Runway** | **Identifier** | **Initial Altitude** |
|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
|   33L/33R  |     ALVAX4F    |        4000ft        |
|   33L/33R  |     ASVIR4F    |        4000ft        |
|   33L/33R  |     BOXIK4F    |        4000ft        |
|   33L/33R  |      KFR4F     |        4000ft        |
|   33L/33R  |     RALKA4F    |        4000ft        |
|   33L/33R  |     SESRU4F    |        4000ft        |

| **Runway** | **Identifier** | **Initial Altitude** |
|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
|   15L/15R  |     ALVAX4E    |        4000ft        |
|   15L/15R  |     ASVIR4E    |        4000ft        |
|   15L/15R  |     BOXIK4E    |        4000ft        |
|   15L/15R  |      KFR4E     |        4000ft        |
|   15L/15R  |     RALKA4E    |        4000ft        |
|   15L/15R  |     SESRU4E    |        4000ft        |

!!!node "D-ATIS"
Again, it must be noted it is the pilots responsibility to ensure they have correctly listened to the D-ATIS so they know the active runways at their departure airport.

The following routes are also flight level capped:

| **Destination** | **Max Altitude / Flight Level** |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|       ORMM      |              FL160              |
|       OEDF      |              FL250              |
|       OBBI      |              FL270              |
|       OTHH      |              FL330              |

## Chapter 3: Requesting Pushback & Start + Taxi

Pilots are expected to have reviewed their Airport Ground Movement Charts to have a good understand of their potential taxi routing.
When you are ready for push back and start this should be requested with the delivery controller or the next relevant controller.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Delivery, JZR741, request push and start Stand B1"**

If delivery is online they will then hand you over to the Ground Controller or next relevant controller who will either delay your pushback or give you a clearance to pushback in a specific direction.

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, push back and start is approved facing South on W17"**_

Prior to commencing your pushback you should again review the charts and ensure you are pushing back as assigned by the controller in the correct direction.
Once your pushback is complete you can then request taxi clearance, again it is your responsibility to review the airport ground movement chart to ensure you have a general idea of your potential taxi routing and any taxiways and holding points along the way.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Ground, JZR741, request taxi"**_

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, taxi to holding point RWY33L via W17, W14 and W1."**_

Upon reaching the holding point if you are not ready for an immediate departure you shall inform the controller as quickly as possible.

## Chapter 4: Takeoff

When handed off to the Tower Controller you will be expected to be ready for departure upon reaching the runway holding point.
You must have cross checked your aircraft systems to ensure you have the correct departure setup.

It is good airmanship to ensure you have the next controllers frequency set in the standby frequency in your VHF system.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, surface wind 330 at 10kts, runway 33L, cleared for takeoff"**_

> **Pilot:** _**"Cleared for take off runway 33L, JZR741"**_

Once you're airbourne the Tower Controller will then hand you over to Approach or the next relevant controller, you must read back the full and correct frequency.

## Chapter 5: Climb Out

Once you have been handed off to the Approach Controller on initial contact you advise the following information:

- Callsign
- Passing Altitude

The Approach Controller will then identify you on radar and clear you further.

---- 

# Arriving Aircraft

## Chapter 1: Initial Contact
As the pilot of your aircraft it is your responsibility to ensure you have listened to the **A-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** so you know the active runways, current weather and any other operational information at the airfeild.

When either the En-Route Controller or Approach Controller asks you to contact them you should do so immediately.
On initial contact with the controller you should provide the following information:

- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Current Flight Level or Altitude
- Current ATIS Letter you're in reciept of

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Center, JZR742 with you FL220, Airbus A320, Information C"**_

Once you have made initial contact the controller will identify you on radar and proceed to give you instructions for how you should arrive into Kuwait.

## Chapter 2: Assigned Standard Terminal Arrival Route & Approach
After you make initial contact with the controller they will provide you with a **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**, an approach aid that you will use for landing at Kuwait and in some cases an altitude to descend too.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR742, Identified, DEBTI3C Arrival, expect ILS Approach Y Runway 33R, descend Flight Level 150."**_

You must read back this clearance in full as it contains very important information.
You must cross check your charts, ensure the arrival assigned is in your navigation data base, if it is not you must inform the controller immediately.

You must adhere to any flight level, altitude or speed restrictions annotated on the relevant arrival chart unless advised otherwise by the controller.

## Chapter 3: Cleared for the Approach

Once the controler has descended you to start your final approach you will be cleared for the approach type you were issued.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR742, via PEDEL, cleared the ILS Y Approach RWY33R, report established"**_

Again, you must read this back correctly and fully.

It is a standard rule of thumb within Kuwait, you should be 180kts at 10DME, 160kts at 4dme to ensure safe and efficent operations.
Once you are established you will advise the controller.

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Approach, JZR742, fully established ILS Y Runway 33R"**_

The Approach Controller will then hand you over to the Tower Controller.

## Chapter 4: Landing Clearance
On initial contact with the Tower Controller you should provide the following.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Tower, JZR742, fully established ILS33R 7DME"**_

The Tower Controller will either advise you to continue approach or clear you to land.

## Chapter 5: After Landing
Upon arrival in Kuwait you should aim to vacate by one of the following points:

| **Runway** | **Exit Points** |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     33R    |   Loop 2        |
|     33L    |   W4 or W5      |
|     15R    |   W2            |
|     15L    |   E2            |

Once you have done so the Tower Controller will provide you with an initial taxi instruction to get you away from the holding point efficently and hand you over to the Ground Controller who will provide you with further taxi instructions to your Stand.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR742, Welcome to Kuwait, taxi via E9, W17, Stand B2."**_

Again, please ensure you have the charts available and read back the instructions correctly.
You will then taxi to stand and no further communications need to be made.

| RWY15L/15R |   VFR Q East   |           East          |                          Pilot should climb to 1000ft on runway heading, when passing the departure end of runway (DER) pilots shall turn left towards Qurain Shopping Area and report overhead.                          |
| RWY15L/15R |   VFR G West   |           West          | Pilots should climb to 1000ft on runway heading, when passing the departure end of runway (DER) pilots shall turn right towards Petrol Station located on the 7th Ring Road beside the drag circuit and report overhead.  |
| RWY33L/33R |   VFR F East   |           East          |                          Pilots should climb to 1000ft on runway heading, when passing the departure end of runway (DER) pilots shall turn right towards Mishrif Fairground on report overhead.                           |
| RWY33L/33R |   VFR U West   |           West          |                        Pilots should climb to 1000ft on runway heading, when passing the departure end of runway (DER) pilots shall turn left towards Alshedadiya University and report overhead.                         |

It is the pilots responsibility to ensure they are fully aware of the departure procedures above.

## Chapter 4: VFR Phraseology

VFR Departure Phraseology

> **Pilot:** _"Kuwait Tower, 9K-VFR with you holding point W2, runway 33L"_

> **TWR:** _"9K-VFR, via W2, cleared for takeoff runway 33L, winds calm, Foxtrot East Procedure, Report Overhead Mishrif Fairground."_

> **Pilot:** _"Via W2, cleared for takeoff runway 33L, Foxtrot East, will report over Mishrif."_

> **Pilot:** _"Kuwait Tower, 9K-VFR overhead Mishrif"_

> **TWR:** _"9-FR, roger, contact Kuwait Approach 124.800"_

!!!node "Callsign Shortening"
With VFR Traffic you are allowed to abbreviate the callsign once contact has been established. Your first transmission with the aircraft must always include their full callsign however, from then on, you may abbreviate the callsign to 3 letters, this helps reduce frequency congestion.

VFR Zone Entry Phraseology

> **Pilot:** _"Kuwait Tower, 9K-VFR with you 5nm North West of the Qurain Shopping Area, Altitude 1000ft, request clearance into the Control Zone for Full Stop Landing"_

> **TWR:** _"9K-VFR, Good Afternoon, cleared to enter the Control Zone, not above altitude 1000ft via Quebec East, VFR, QNH 1001, Squawk 7001"_

> **Pilot:** _"Cleared to enter the Control Zone not above altitude 1000ft via Quebec East, VFR QNH 1001, Squawk 7001"_

> **TWR:** _"9-FR, Readback Correct, report left downwind runway 15L."_

!!!node "Controller Preference"
The Controller can elect where to have the inbound VFR traffic head to after they have recieved their initial zone entry clearance depending on traffic levels.

VFR Circuits

> **Pilot:** _"Kuwait Tower, 9K-VFR, with you holding point E2, ready for departure"_

> **TWR:** _"9K-VFR, after departure right hand turn out, via W2, cleared for takeoff RWY33R, winds calm"_

> **Pilot:** _"After departure right hand turn out, via W2, cleared for takeoff RWY33R, 9K-VFR"_

Once the aircraft is airborne and established on the right hand turn off you can advise them to report downwind with intentions.

> **TWR:** _"9-FR, report downwind with intentions"_

> **Pilot:** _"Wilco, 9-FR"_

> **Pilot:** _"9-FR, right hand downwind RWY33R for touch and go"_

> **TWR:** _"9-FR, roger, you are number 2 to a Qatari Airbus A350 on 5nm final, maintain visual separation, caution wake turbulence, report final runway 33R"_

> **Pilot:** _"traffic is in sight, maintaining visual separation, will report final runway 33R, 9-FR"_

> **Pilot:** _"A-ZZ, final runway 33R"_


> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, cleared touch and go runway 33R, winds calm, report downwind"_
