# Pilot Briefing

## Requesting Clearance

Prior to contacting Kuwait Delivery (DEL) the pilot should have listened to the **D-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** to obtain the latest and up to date current weather conditions at **Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)** along with any additional airfield operational information such as runway information, closures etc.

On first contact with Kuwait Delivery you as the pilot should report the following information:

- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Stand Number
- Current ATIS Information Letter
- Current QNH

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Delivery, JZR741, Airbus A320, Stand B1, Information D On-board, QNH 1002, requesting IFR Clearance to Giza"**_

The controller will then proceed to give you a clearance which must be read back in **full** and **correctly**.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, Good Afternoon, cleared to Giza via the KFR4F, climb initially altitude 4000ft, Squawk 4414"**_

Below you can find the Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) from OKKK and their initial altitudes.

!!!node "D-ATIS"
Again, it must be noted it is the pilots responsibility to ensure they have correctly listened to the D-ATIS so they know the active runways at their departure airport.

The following routes are also flight level capped:

| **Destination** | **Max Altitude / Flight Level** |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|       ORMM      |              FL160              |
|       OEDF      |              FL250              |
|       OBBI      |              FL270              |
|       OTHH      |              FL330              |

## Requesting Pushback & Start + Taxi

Pilots are expected to have reviewed their Airport Ground Movement Charts to have a good understand of their potential taxi routing.
When you are ready for push back and start this should be requested with the delivery controller or the next relevant controller.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Delivery, JZR741, request push and start Stand B1"**

If delivery is online they will then hand you over to the Ground Controller or next relevant controller who will either delay your pushback or give you a clearance to pushback in a specific direction.

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, push back and start is approved facing South on W17"**_

Prior to commencing your pushback you should again review the charts and ensure you are pushing back as assigned by the controller in the correct direction.
Once your pushback is complete you can then request taxi clearance, again it is your responsibility to review the airport ground movement chart to ensure you have a general idea of your potential taxi routing and any taxiways and holding points along the way.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Kuwait Ground, JZR741, request taxi"**_

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, taxi to holding point RWY33L via W17, W14 and W1."**_

Upon reaching the holding point if you are not ready for an immediate departure you shall inform the controller as quickly as possible.

## Takeoff Procedures

When handed off to the Tower Controller you will be expected to be ready for departure upon reaching the runway holding point.
You must have cross checked your aircraft systems to ensure you have the correct departure setup.

It is good airmanship to ensure you have the next controllers frequency set in the standby frequency in your VHF system.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, surface wind 330 at 10kts, runway 33L, cleared for takeoff"**_

> **Pilot:** _**"Cleared for take off runway 33L, JZR741"**_

Once you're airborne the Tower Controller will then hand you over to Approach or the next relevant controller, you must read back the full and correct frequency.

## Climb Out

Once you have been handed off to the Approach Controller on initial contact you advise the following information:

- Callsign
- Passing Altitude
