# Pilot Briefing

## Requesting Clearance

Prior to contacting Bahrain Delivery (DEL) the pilot should have listened to the **D-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** to obtain the latest and up to date current weather conditions at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)** along with any additional airfield operational information such as runway information, closures etc.

On first contact with Bahrain Delivery you as the pilot should report the following information:

- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Stand Number
- Current ATIS Information Letter
- Current QNH

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Delivery, GFA101, Airbus A320, Stand 22, Information D On-board, QNH 1002, requesting IFR Clearance to Dubai"**_

The controller will then proceed to give you a clearance which must be read back in **full** and **correctly**.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, Good Afternoon, cleared to Dubai via N697 SODAK P559 NALPO, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, initial climb 4000ft, Squawk 4414"**_

As there are no **Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)** all aircraft are cleared via the airway to the Bahrain FIR exit point and issued a heading to fly after departure.
This is must be flown correctly to avoid aircraft turning towards the BHR VOR which will enter aircraft into restricted airspace.

The initial headings issued in Bahrain based on direction can be viewed below.

| **Runway** | **TMA Exit Point** | **Initial Heading** |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|     30R    |        NARMI       |         300         |
|     30R    |        TULUB       |         345         |
|     30R    |        SODAK       |         345         |
|     30R    |        ASTAD       |         345         |
|     30R    |        LOTOR       |         345         |

| **Runway** | **TMA Exit Point** | **Initial Heading** |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|     12L    |        TULUB       |         120         |
|     12L    |        NARMI       |         075         |
|     12L    |        SODAK       |         075         |
|     12L    |        ASTAD       |         075         |
|     12L    |        LOTOR       |         075         |

Various flights also have flight level caps which you can find below:

| **Destination** | **Max Altitude / Flight Level** |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|       OT**      |             11000ft             |
|       OM**      |              FL250              |
|       OKKK      |              FL260              |
|       OEDF      |              6000ft             |

## Requesting Pushback & Start + Taxi

Pilots are expected to have reviewed their Airport Ground Movement Charts to have a good understand of their potential taxi routing.
When you are ready for push back and start this should be requested with the delivery controller or the next relevant controller.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Delivery, GFA101, request push and start Stand 22"**

If delivery is online they will then hand you over to the Ground Controller or next relevant controller who will either delay your pushback or give you a clearance to pushback in a specific direction.

> **Controller:** _**"GFA101, push back and start is approved facing East on Zulu"**_

Prior to commencing your pushback you should again review the charts and ensure you are pushing back as assigned by the controller in the correct direction.
Once your pushback is complete you can then request taxi clearance, again it is your responsibility to review the airport ground movement chart to ensure you have a general idea of your potential taxi routing and any taxiways and holding points along the way.

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Ground, GFA101, request taxi"**_

> **Controller:** _**"GFA101, taxi to holding point A9 RWY30R via Z, S and A."**_

Upon reaching the holding point if you are not ready for an immediate departure you shall inform the controller as quickly as possible.

## Takeoff Procedures

When handed off to the Tower Controller you will be expected to be ready for departure upon reaching the runway holding point.
You must have cross-checked your aircraft systems to ensure you have the correct departure setup.

It is good airmanship to ensure you have the next controllers frequency set in the standby frequency in your VHF system.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"GFA101, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, surface wind 330 at 10kts, runway 30R, cleared for takeoff"**_

> **Pilot:** _**"Cleared for take off runway 30R, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, GFA101"**_

Once you're airborne, **Bahrain Tower** will then hand you over to **Bahrain Approach** or the next relevant controller, you must read back the full and correct frequency.

## Climb Out

Once you have been handed off to the Approach Controller on initial contact you advise the following information:

- Callsign
- Passing Altitude
- Assigned Heading

The Approach Controller will then identify you on radar and clear you further.
