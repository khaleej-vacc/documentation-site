# Pilot Briefing

## Initial Contact
As the pilot of your aircraft it is your responsibility to ensure you have listened to the **A-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** so you know the active runways, current weather and any other operational information at the airfield.

On initial contact with the controller you should provide the following information:

- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Current Flight Level or Altitude
- Current ATIS Letter you're in receipt of

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Radar, GFA520, FL260, Airbus A320, Information C."**_

Once you have made initial contact, the controller will proceed to give you instructions for how you should arrive into Bahrain. This will include an **expected approach* and a **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**.

## Standard Terminal Arrival Routes

Bahrain has 3 STARs. They are applicable to both 12L and 30R.

|     **Direction**     |   **STAR**   |
|:---------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|       Eastern Arrivals          |       ORDIG1       |
|      Northern Arrivals        |       KOBOK1        |
|      Western Arrivals        |       LADNA1        |

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, Identified, ORDIG1 Arrival, expect ILS Approach Runway 30R, descend Flight Level 160."**_

You must read back this clearance in full.
You must cross-check your charts, ensure the arrival assigned is in your navigation database, if it is not you must inform the controller immediately.

You must adhere to any flight level, altitude or speed restrictions annotated on the relevant arrival chart unless advised otherwise by the controller.

## Approach

Once the controller has descended you to start your final approach you will be cleared for the approach type you were issued.

Example:

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, turn right heading 270 degrees, cleared ILS Approach RWY30R, report established"**_

Again, you must read this back correctly and fully.

!!!node "Act Promptly"
    Due to Bahrain's small TMA, Pilots must remain vigilant and maintain close attention to the frequency.

Pilots may be asked to maintain a speed until a certain mile final (e.g. 160 Knots until 4 DME).

> **Pilot:** _**"GFA520, fully established ILS Runway 30R"**_

The Approach Controller will then hand you over to the Tower Controller.

## Landing
Upon arrival in Bahrain you should aim to vacate by one of the following points:

| **Runway** | **Standard Vacating Points** |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     30R    |   A4  |
|     12L    |   A6  |

Once you have done so, **Bahrain Tower** will provide you with initial taxi instructions and hand you over to **Bahrain Ground** who will provide you with further taxi instructions to your stand.

Again, please ensure you have the charts available and read back the instructions correctly.

## Missed Approach Procedure

In the event of a missed approach/go around, pilots shall follow the standard missed approach procedure as charted unless advised otherwise by ATC.

|     **Runway**     |   **Procedure**   |
|:---------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|       **30R**          |       Fly heading 300° and climb to 2500ft       |
|       **12L**          |       Fly heading 120° and climb to 2500ft       |

### Additional Notes

- When asked to **monitor** the next frequency, simply tune the frequency and wait for further instructions. No transmission is required from your end.
- Do not increase your speed, or descend below your assigned altitude/level without prior approval from ATC.
- Pilots shall be aware that runway **30L/12R** is **permanently closed**.
- When a controller asks you to contact them you should do so immediately.
