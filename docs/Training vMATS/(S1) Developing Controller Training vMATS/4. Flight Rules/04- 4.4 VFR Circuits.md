title: 4.4. VFR Circuits 
---
The VFR circuit is a flight pattern conducted near an airport, where a pilot takes off from a specific runway, follows a circuit pattern, and ultimately lands on the same runway. 

The direction of the circuit is determined by factors such as the departure runway, the number of runways at the airport, and the surrounding terrain. These factors influence the choice of the circuit direction to ensure safe and efficient aircraft operations in the vicinity of the airport.

Controllers should review the relevant **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for Kuwait or Bahrain for more detailed information regarding traffic patterns. 

In order to prevent conflicts and delays, it is generally not permitted for aircraft to fly over center runways in both directions during VFR circuits (Unless permitted by eAIP/SOPs). This is because such a configuration can impede the movement and create potential conflicts with aircraft using the other runway. As a result, specific procedures and guidelines are implemented to ensure that VFR circuits are conducted in a manner that maintains safe separation and efficient movement of aircraft at the airport.
