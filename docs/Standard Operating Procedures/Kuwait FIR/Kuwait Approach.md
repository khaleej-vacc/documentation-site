## Chapter 2. Airspace
The **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** has a vertical extension up to FL150.


|         Airspace Type         |   Airspace  | Class | Vertical Limits | Controller |
|:-----------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----:|:---------------:|------------|
|       **Control Area**        | Kuwait CTA  |   C   | SFC - 6000ft    | OKKK_F_APP |
|       **Control Area**        | Kuwait CTA  |   C   | SFC - FL150     | OKKK_APP   |

### 2.1 Transition Altitude and Level
The transition altitude and level in Kuwait is consistent with the Gulf Region.

| **Transition Altitude** | **Transition Level** |
|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|
|         13000ft         |         FL150        |

The transition layer exists between these two altitudes and is **not to be used** by controllers or aircraft alike for level flight.

### 2.2 Aerodromes within the Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)
The APP Controller is responsible for **Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)**, **Ali Al Salem Airbase (OKAS)** and **Ahmed Al Jaber Airbase (OKAJ)**

Both Ali Al Salem and Ahmed Al Jaber Airbases are military airfields to which we do not provide ATC services for on the ground.

# Chapter 3. GEN | Standard Operating Procedures

### 3.1 Separation Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Longitudinal Separation Requirements
All aircraft within the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** must be separated with a **minimum of 7nm longitudinal separation.**

#### 3.1.2 Vertical Separation
In the event that longitudinal separation cannot be achieved aircraft must be separated with a **minimum of 1000ft separation.**

#### 3.1.3 Speed Control
In order for aircraft to complete any required turns within the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** and to safely operate within the laterally confined airspace speed control can be issued to aircraft.

Speed Control can also be utilised to maintain separation between climbing traffic.

The standard speed restriction below 10,000ft is 250kts.

#### 3.1.4 Wake Turbulence Separation (WTS)
The following **Wake Turbulence Separation (WTS)** shall be applied to aircraft being provided with a Surveillance Based Separation (SBS) which is utilised within the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)**

| **Trailing   Aircraft** | **Behind** | **Leading   Aircraft** | **Distance Separation Minima** |
|:-----------------------:|:----------:|------------------------|-------------------------------|
|        Light (L)        |            |       Medium (M)       |              5nm              |
|        Medium (M)       |            |        Heavy (H)       |              5nm              |
|        Light (L)        |            |        Heavy (H)       |              6nm              |
|        Heavy (H)        |            |        Heavy (H)       |              4nm              |
|        Medium (M)       |            |          A380          |              7nm              |
|        Light (L)        |            |          A380          |              8nm              |

The 7nm longitudinal separation requirements within the TMA **overrides any wake turbulence separation minima which is lower than the minimum longitudinal separation requirements.**

#### 3.2.1 Initial Contact
Upon initial contact with a departing aircraft after being handed over from the **TWR Controller** aircraft should report the following information.

- Callsign
- Heading
- Passing Altitude

If an aircraft does not report their passing altitude on initial contact it must be requested from the pilot in order to verify radar contact and cross-check that they are showing the correct altitude on radar.
This can be within a 300ft +/- range of their reported passing altitude.

> **APP Controller:** _**"KAC505, reporting your passing altitude."**_

Once you have confirmed their passing altitude against the altitude showing on radar you can confirm they're identified on radar and proceed to clear them as necessary.

> **APP Controller:** _**"KAC505, identified, continue climb FL150, route direct SESRU."**_

#### 3.2.2 Handing Aircraft Off
Due to the location of Kuwait and direction of some flights not all aircraft will be handed off to the en-route controller as they will not enter their airspace.
Some flights will be handed off to adjacent approach units or en-route positions.

The **Approach Controller** should be aware of which controller an aircraft needs to be handed over to based on the lateral and vertical confinements of his airspace and the adjacent unit.

| **Radio Callsign** | **Logon Callsign** | **Frequency** |
|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|
|   Kuwait Tower     |     OKKK_TWR       |    118.300    |
|   Kuwait Director  |     OKKK_F_APP     |    123.825    |
|   Kuwait Radar     |     OKAC_CTR       |    125.300    |
|   Jeddah Control   |     OEJD_1_CTR     |    126.500    |
|   Baghdad Approach |     ORMM_APP       |    120.200    |

### 3.2 Arrival Procedures
**Kuwait Approach (APP)** is responsible for ensuring all aircraft arriving into the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** are safely separated vertically and laterally before being handed off to the TWR Controller on final approach.
All aircraft shall be sequenced within the limitations listed within Section 3.1 of this document.

#### 3.2.1 Initial Contact
Aircraft arriving into the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** are to be provided with a set of instructions which will allow the aircraft to fly an assigned routing, descend in a manner which will keep them separated from other traffic and under a controlled speed to ensure traffic is sequenced into the TMA efficiently.

Upon initial contact the **Approach Controller** should provide a pilot with the following information in the event the **ACC Controller** above them is not online:

- **The Assigned Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**
- **The Approach Aid in which they will use to land at the airport along with the active runway**
- **An altitude to which to descend to if necessary**
- **Local Pressure at the Airfield of Arrival**

> **APP Controller:** _**"DHX268, Identified, expect ILS Approach 33L, information A, QNH 1013."**_

If the **ACC Controller** is online, and they're arriving from the Kuwait En-Route Environment then Kuwait Radar will provide them with their expected **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**.

Remember it is the responsibility of the Approach Controller to ensure all aircraft are identified on initial contact, aircraft should be assigned an individual squawk code if not already and squawking mode 'Charlie' which provides altitude information.

#### 3.2.2 Sequencing Aircraft
All aircraft entering the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** should be sequenced in order to ensure separation is always maintained, it is wholly the responsibility of the **APP Controller** to have a plan for all aircraft and know their position in sequence. This can be achieved by ensuring aircraft are under speed control and descending in a controlled manner in accordance with the **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**.

The **APP Controller** should always have a clear plan of action when controlling and keep things as uniform as possible, this will ensure a constant steady flow of arriving traffic whilst ensuring all traffic are safely separated.

#### 3.2.3 Holdings
If at any point the controller is unable to manage the traffic load within the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** it is their responsibility to place aircraft into the hold until traffic can once again be sequenced for an approach to the runway.

Within the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** there are 6 published holding procedures, and they are as follows:

| **Hold Identifier** | **Vertical Limits** | **Inbound Holding Course** | **Maximum Holding Speed** | **Turn Direction** |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|---------------------------|--------------------|
|        DEBTI        |   3000ft - FL460    |            314°            |           250kts          |        Right       |
|        RALKA        |   3000ft - FL460    |            275°            |           250kts          |        Right       |
|         KFR         |   3000ft - FL460    |            078°            |           250kts          |        Right       |

It is imperative that the **APP Controller** fully understands the standard procedures of each of the above holding patterns within the **Kuwait Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)**.
This should include the vertical limits, inbound holding courses, maximum holding speed and the direction of turns they can expect aircraft to carry out if entered into one of the published holds.

If it is required to put an aircraft in one of the above holds the following phraseology should be used.

> **APP Controller:** _**"KAC164, enter the published hold at DEBTI, descend altitude 8000ft, expect 10 minute delay."**_

Aircraft will have published holds within their aircraft AIRAC cycle uploaded into their FMC by standard. However, in the event they do not you will be required to provide the aircraft with the full requirements to carry out the hold procedure.

> **APP Controller:** _**"KAC164, enter the hold at SESRU, inbound course 073°, descend altitude 8000ft, right hand turns, expect 10-minute delay"**_

#### 3.2.4.1 Holding Altitudes
If placing aircraft in the hold they must always as per Section 3.1 remain vertically separated by 1000ft. When placing multiple aircraft into the same holding pattern they can not all hold at the same altitude so the **APP Controller** is responsible for ensuring each aircraft has its own block altitude within the holding pattern.

For instance, the 1st aircraft would enter the hold at 8000ft, 2nd aircraft would enter the hold at 9000ft, 3rd aircraft would enter the hold at 10000ft and so-and-so forth.

When the requirement for the hold is no longer required, the aircraft at the bottom of the hold will be given instruction to exit first whether that be by radar vectors or to carry on with the published **Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR)**, this will then allow the 2nd aircraft within the holding pattern to descend to the block altitude within the holding pattern that the previous aircraft held.

The **APP Controller** will continue to descend aircraft in the holding pattern until it is there time to leave the hold.
